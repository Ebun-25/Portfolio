      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Ebunoluwa Shokefun. A Computer Science student with experience in IT support, cybersecurity, and software development.

I’ve worked in technical roles at U.S. Bank and SMSU, built projects in Python and C++, and completed hands-on labs in ethical hacking.

Outside of tech, I’m a Resident Assistant and student leader, passionate about helping others and creating supportive communities.

I’m always learning, building, and exploring new ways to solve problems and make an impact in both tech and everyday life..</p>
