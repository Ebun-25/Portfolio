      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Ebunoluwa — a Computer Science graduate and aspiring cybersecurity analyst driven by a mission to protect people and data in an increasingly digital world.

My passion for cybersecurity stems from a deep desire to help others avoid becoming victims of cybercrimes. With hands-on experience in IT support, loan servicing, and network troubleshooting, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation and a problem-solving mindset that fuels my growth in the field.
Currently, I’m building my skills through cybersecurity coursework, ethical hacking labs, and certifications like CompTIA. I’m especially interested in threat detection, network security, and ethical hacking — always exploring new ways to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
Whether I’m configuring secure systems, analyzing vulnerabilities, or mentoring peers, I’m committed to making digital spaces safer for everyone. Thanks for visiting my site — check out my projects, or connect with me to collaborate!...</p>
